Slash command key pieces:
    1. The individual command files, containing their definitions and functionality.
    2. The command handler, which dynamically reads the files and executes the commands.
    3. The command deployment script, to register your slash commands with Discord so they appear in the interface.

Ephemeral responses ( secret response):
    await interaction.reply({ content: 'Secret Pong!', ephemeral: true });
